    <p>The High School Personality Questionnaire (HSPQ) is a self-report inventory 
       for adolescents that measures 14 primary personality characteristics which are

       school behaviours (such as school achievement, vocational fitness, danger of delinquency,
       likelihood of leadership qualities, need for clinical help in neurotic condition, etc.).

       <a href="https://www.idosi.org/mejsr/mejsr17(11)13/3.pdf">"Information Culture as Factor of Self-Attitude Developing in Adolescents"</a> undertaken
